# Weather App

> This is a React weather app, displaying data from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) with current and forecast weather in London for the next week. This app displays weather as soon as it opens and it shows a countdown bar of 60s and then auto refresh the weather information every minute.

## [Live site](https://weatherapp-zee.netlify.app/)
- **Updated Css**

## Functionalities

This weather app has fetched the following data: 
- **Weather**
- **Weather description** 
- **Weather Icon** 
- **Current Time** 
- **Day of the week** 

The top countdown bar has set for 60s and the it'll refresh the weather information.

## Improvement
On going with more time, things could be improved:
- **Layout/UI of the applications**
- **Switch between celsius and fahrenheit**
- **automation when initially loading the data and fetching the data**
- **Count down more smooth maybe with number**
- **Jest Unit testing to validate and ensure the app is performing as expected**


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
